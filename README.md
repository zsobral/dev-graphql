# dev-server

This repo is a result through my journey to learn more about GraphQL, monorepos and microservices

My GraphQL reference was this awesome book https://8bit.press/book/advanced-graphql by [@mandiwise](https://twitter.com/mandiwise) and for monorepos and microservices just my googling knowledge

The GraphQL server is build with Apollo Federation, with three services

- account: handle authentication with Auth0
- profile: handle authenticated users profiles
- content: handle users posts and medias
